Getting Started with the Knox SDK Sample
===========================================

This sample application is an introduction on how to implement the following functionalities:
- activate an application as a device administrator
- activate/deactivate a license
- toggle the device camera restriction policy on/off (only a standard license key needed)
- toggle the tima keystore state (premium license key needed)


Introduction
------------

The Samsung Knox SDK combines existing enterprise and security SDKs into one SDK.
This application demonstrates how to use a KPE standard or Premium license key to access Standard and Premium permission APIs of the Knox SDK. It also provides you with a backwards compatibile key to run applications built with the Knox SDK on older Pre-Knox SDK capable devices.
